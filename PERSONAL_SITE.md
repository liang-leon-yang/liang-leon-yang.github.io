# Personal website content

The primary pages use `_layouts/profile.html` and `assets/css/profile.css`, independently of the legacy Academic Pages archive styles.

| Page | English | Chinese |
| --- | --- | --- |
| About | `/` | `/zh/` |
| Research | `/publications/` | `/zh/publications/` |
| CV | `/cv/` | `/zh/cv/` |
| Talks | `/talks/` | `/zh/talks/` |

- Edit `_data/profile.yml` for biography, education, research, publications, projects, patents, and academic service. It uses JSON syntax, which is valid YAML. `en` and `zh` values contain the two language versions.
- Edit `_data/profile_ui.yml` for navigation and interface labels. Edit `_data/research_agenda.yml` for the bilingual research map and its links to stored publication IDs.
- Publication groups are `journal`, `review`, `working`, and `conference`. Homepage research entries are ordered by `highlights`, with `selected` kept in sync for the selected paper records. Author-role labels are separate from review status.
- Publication titles remain in their original language. The 2027 journal issue year follows the supplied CV and is explicitly annotated. Review stages are a snapshot of the supplied CV, not automatically updated.
- Both language versions are static, with matching canonical and hreflang links. Navigation does not require JavaScript. JavaScript enables the CV print action and optional research-direction emphasis; printed CVs include the publication list. Text and controls remain visible and usable if JavaScript is unavailable.
- The legacy `_publications` URLs remain available. If an existing paper changes status or title, also update its legacy record.

Build with the repository's existing Jekyll workflow (`bundle exec jekyll build`). No new production dependencies are required.

Local validation: all eight primary routes were rendered with LiquidJS and checked in headless Edge at 320, 390, 680, 768, 800, and 1440 px, including language switching, internal links, publication counts, no-JavaScript navigation, and print styles. The research map also passed bilingual paper-anchor checks, direction selection/reset, keyboard Enter/Space, static no-JavaScript reading, reduced-motion use, and print checks. A native Jekyll build was not run because Ruby/Bundler is unavailable in the editing environment.

Design: a restrained personal website with a small portrait, a concise introduction, research summaries, and links to publication and talk pages. Research details, CV, and talks live on separate pages. Keep the white background and avoid decorative cards or promotional headlines. Only the current affiliation is stored in the public profile and education data. Do not restore previous education or visiting affiliations. Do not include advisor names or supervision relationships in biographies or education entries; publication author lists remain accurate. The alternate CV route redirects to `/cv/`.

Typography uses self-hosted Source Sans 3 for headings, body text, and navigation, with system sans-serif fonts for Chinese. The shared reading width is 960px. The homepage has an introduction with a portrait on the right, a three-direction research map, aligned figure-and-text research entries, and recent talks below the research. See `assets/fonts/README.md` for licenses and subset maintenance. Research navigation and sections list under-review manuscripts first in both languages.

Selected research uses figures extracted from the actual papers, with source records in `assets/images/FIGURE_SOURCES.md`. Render figures with `object-fit: contain` and allow opening full-size images. Never substitute stock photos or figures from a different version of a paper. A selected paper without its own source figure remains text-only.

The homepage showcases the five selected papers. The Research page and printed CV include every publication in the profile data, preserving complete titles, author lists, venues, years, review stages, author roles, and available overviews. Research navigation lists under-review/revision papers, journal articles, working papers, and conference papers in that order. Layout or animation changes must not reduce the scope of displayed research content.

The profile photo is the user-provided coastal portrait at `images/portrait-coast.jpg`, used by the bilingual homepage and legacy author profile. Keep the supplied image unchanged; the face and upper body are framed with CSS in `.profile-avatar img`.

Selected papers have bilingual `overview.en` / `overview.zh` fields in `_data/profile.yml`. These editorial research introductions appear in native expandable details on the homepage and as visible text on the research page; CV entries stay concise. They are summaries, not verbatim abstracts. The introductions for `empathy`, `icis25`, `icis24night`, and `icis24support` follow the corresponding local paper abstracts. The `support` introduction follows its current title and existing homepage summary because the available local source is a review letter for an earlier version; do not attribute findings or methods from that version to the current manuscript.

The visual system uses a white background, neutral black and gray text, and a single burgundy accent (#8b2439) for links and active research steps. Do not restore pastel panels, blurred gradients, portrait halos, decorative floating particles, or rounded promotional cards. Keep the existing typography and all original paper figures.

The homepage research map replaces the former looping method demos and repeated research-interest list. It connects the common theme of AI for health with three parallel research directions and two related papers per direction. These are thematic relationships, not a causal pipeline. Short link labels point to complete, unchanged publication records; do not invent results or imply that manuscripts are published. The five selected research entries and their original figures remain below the map.

Clicking a direction emphasizes that branch and its links without hiding or filtering any research. Clicking it again or using All directions restores the overview. Native buttons support keyboard operation; no content is gated behind JavaScript. Without JavaScript, all headings, research questions, methods, and paper links remain visible. The mobile layout reads as three rows without connector lines. There is no automatic animation or carousel.
